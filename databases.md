**Quick word about searching for *data*:**

The important when searching for an information, is **where to find it**. 

I hope this short list helps to clarify what is the **purpose** of each **publisher** of information (website, entity, publisher...), and the **type** of dataset you can find.

It's also important to keep in mind the **thematic** of the data,the **perspective** of the analysis (financial, law, technical...) and to understand the **problematic** behind a data collection or agglomeration (for example what problem people are trying to solve and how these data can help?).


**disclaimer**: Most additions to the list are quick notes from study cases. Feel free to add any resources usefull to you and your team. 

Each line tells if [MISP](https://github.com/MISP/MISP) has an import module related to it. If not, and you would like to see the integration, you can post an issue directly on the [MISP repository] (https://github.com/MISP/MISP/issues)
